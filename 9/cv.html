        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="info">
          I am a student of <b><a class="custom-a" href="https://khai.edu/">KHAI</a></b> university.
          I focused on <i><b>front-end development</b></i> as I had heard that <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and
          <b>JavaScript</b> were easy to pick up.
          In the bustling world of technology and digital innovation, I found myself standing at the gates of knowledge
          as a humble student at KHAI University. Armed with ambition and a thirst for learning, I embarked on a journey
          that would shape my future in the realm of front-end development.

          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript beckoned me with promises of ease and versatility. Intrigued by the allure of these
          foundational web technologies, I dedicated myself to mastering them. The year was 2016, and I knew that the
          path ahead was not going to be easy, but my determination soared high, fueled by the countless success stories
          and opportunities that lay ahead for skilled developers.

          After the daily grind of my university classes and other commitments, my evenings became sacred as I delved
          into the vast sea of online tutorials. Platforms like Treehouse, Lynda, and Codecademy became my virtual
          mentors, guiding me through the intricacies of front-end development. Patiently, I soaked up every piece of
          knowledge, cherishing each new concept as a valuable gem in my ever-growing arsenal of skills.

          The months flew by, and the first quarter of the year had already come to a close. As March gave way to April,
          my efforts bore fruit. My notebook, once blank and unassuming, now boasted an intricate tapestry of meticulous
          notes. These scribbles were not merely lines on paper; they were my tangible memories of the lessons learned,
          the epiphanies that shaped my understanding, and the steps I took towards mastery.

          But, despite my growing knowledge and the small victories I had achieved, a sense of restlessness took hold of
          me. My heart yearned for a more significant challenge, a chance to test my newfound abilities on a grander
          scale. I knew I had to embrace the practical side of my journey and move beyond the realm of static sites.

          The spark of ambition ignited within me, and I set my sights on a larger project that would allow me to sink
          my teeth into the world of real-world development. My GitHub profile, once adorned with a few modest static
          sites, would soon witness a profound transformation, becoming a repository of innovation and creativity.
