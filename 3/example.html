        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a student of <b><a href="https://khai.edu/">KHAI</a></b> university.
            I focused on <i><b>front-end development</b></i> as I had heard that <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> were easy to pick up.
            I spent my evenings after work parsing through Treehouse, Lynda, and Codecademy tutorials.
            The first three months of 2016 passed by like this.
            By April, my notebook was full of thorough notes and my GitHub contained a few static sites.
            But I wasnâ€™t satisfied. I wanted to sink my teeth into a larger project.
